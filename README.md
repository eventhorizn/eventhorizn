## Howdy!

My name is Gary Hake and I'm primarily a .net developer.

I work at a company called Waystar and develop a health insurance patient payment system. Pretty similar to a HSA site.

Throughout my career, I've usually stuck with .net, but I've hit the full stack
  1. Back-end with sql server
     - A bit with MongoDB
  1. Data layer coding with Entity Framework
     - I usually develop my own back-end layer
  1. Services
     - WCF, web api, soap
  1. Fat client apps
     - WinForm, WPF
  1. Web development
     - Razor, ASP.net
     
Outside of .net I find myself interested in probably too many things

1. Python and data analytics
1. DevOps
1. Containers
1. Server management and deployment
1. Scripting
1. Database development

Ultimately, I like software because there's just so much to do and learn
